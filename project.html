                    <h2>Smart Street Lights</h2>
                    <p>It is seen in a number of cities that the street light is one of the huge expenses in a city. The cost spent is huge that all the sodium vapor lamps consume more power. 
                      The expense spent on the street light can be used for other development of the nation.Currently a manual system is used where the light will be made to switched ON/OFF 
                      i.e the light will be made to switch ON in the evening and switched OFF in the morning. Hence there is a lot of wastage of energy between the ON/OFF.
                      This is one of the major causes of shifting to the automatic system, since there is less wastage of power and thus saving a lot of monetary expenses.
                      Using differrent sensers we can actually reduce consumption of energy.

                      Sending notification to corporationgarbage collectors when dustbin isnearly full and also the location. It willsave workers time as well as fuel.
